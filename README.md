# stroke_prediction_ML_SVC
Here you go having a look at my first larger machine learning project - welcome and thanks for checking in!

The goal:
The goal was to 
  - use some real world data from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset),
  - conduct an exploratory data analysis on the data
  - apply a machine learning algorithm to it
  - optimize the performance (as far as possible)
  - try out various optimization techniques (on the data, the algorithms, the prediction results...)
  - and critically review the results of the applied algorithm

The steps I made:
  - Implement some initial model
  - choose an adequate scoring method
  - Find a suitable starting point for a gridsearch
  - Implement some visual aid to navigate through the parameter space when optimizing the parameter choice
  - Try out, how feature engineering, resampling, and thresholding (the results) could improve the overall performance
  - Set up the neccessary transformers, wrapper classes, and a pipeline to enable a global optimization

How to get a first impression:
  - Check the documentation folder! You will find two separate documents: one for the data analysis, one for the machine learning project!
  - If you like, check out my short demo video of the project (available in the folder "documentation and video wrap up": "Machine Learning stroke prediction SVC final.mp4")
    
Thanks for the visit!

Feel free to contact me anytime, if you have questions, improvement ideas, if you found bugs (I hope you will, as I'm on a learning track and happy for any feedback!)

Cheers!
Patrick
