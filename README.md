# stroke_prediction_ML_SVC

## Here you go having a look at my first larger machine learning project - welcome and thanks for checking in!  

### The goal  
The goal was to:  
- Use some real-world data from Kaggle ([Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset))  
- Conduct an exploratory data analysis on the data  
- Apply a machine learning algorithm to it  
- Optimize the performance (as far as possible)  
- Try out various optimization techniques (on the data, the algorithms, the prediction results...)  
- Critically review the results of the applied algorithm  

### The steps I made  
- Implement some initial model  
- Choose an adequate scoring method  
- Find a suitable starting point for a grid search  
- Implement visual aids to navigate through the parameter space when optimizing the parameter choice  
- Try out how feature engineering, resampling, and thresholding (the results) could improve overall performance  
- Set up the necessary transformers, wrapper classes, and a pipeline to enable global optimization  

### How to get a first impression  
- **Check the documentation folder!**  
  - You will find two separate documents:  
    - One for the data analysis  
    - One for the machine learning project  
- **Watch the short wrap up video**  
  - Available in the `"documentation and video wrap up"` folder  
  - File: `"Machine Learning Stroke Prediction SVC Final.mp4"`  

### Thanks for the visit!  
Feel free to contact me anytime if you have questions, improvement ideas, or if you find bugs (I hope you will, as I'm on a learning track and happy for any feedback!).  

Cheers!
