# stroke_prediction_ML_SVC
Here you go having a look at my first larger machine learning project - welcome and thanks for checking in!

The goal:
The goal was to 
  - use some real world data from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset),
  - conduct an exploratory data analysis on the data
  - apply a machine learning algorithm to it
  - optimize the performance (as far as possible)
  - try out various optimization techniques (on the data, the algorithms, the prediction results...)
  - and critically review the results of the applied algorithm

The steps I made:
  - Implement some initial model
  - choose an adequate scoring method
  - Find a suitable starting point for a gridsearch
  - Implement some visual aid to navigate through the parameter space when optimizing the parameter choice
  - Try out, how feature engineering, resampling, and thresholding (the results) could improve the overall performance
  - Set up the neccessary transformers, wrapper classes, and a pipeline to enable a global optimization

How to get a first impression:
  - Check the documentation folder! You will find two separate documents: one for the data analysis, one for the machine learning project!
  - If you like, check out my short demo video of the project (available on top level of this repo: "Machine Learning stroke prediction SVC final.mp4")
